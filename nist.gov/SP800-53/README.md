# NIST maintained OSCAL content for NIST Special Publication 800-53

NIST is maintaining OSCAL content for multiple revisions of the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53. The XML, JSON, and YAML versions of SP800-53 given here are derived from the NIST publications. These OSCAL files are intended to faithfully to represent the published documents in machinable readable form.

OSCAL XML-, JSON-, and YAML-based content is provided for the following revisions:

- NIST [SP 800-53 Revision 4][sp800-53-rev4] OSCAL catalog and baseline profiles [content][sp800-53-rev4-oscal].
- NIST [SP 800-53 Revision 5][sp800-53-rev5] Final Public Draft (FPD) OSCAL catalog and [SP 800-53B][sp800-53B] (draft) baseline [content][sp800-53-rev5-oscal].

    Note: In the SP 800-53 Revision 5 FPD, the control catalog and control baselines are separated. The control baselines are published as [SP 800-53B][sp800-53B] (draft).

    Please refer to the [publication announcement][sp800-53-rev5-announcement] for more information, along with information on providing feedback on the draft.

The OSCAL XML, JSON, and YAML variants are all equivalent in their information content. These variants are provided to support tooling on different format-specific implementation stacks.
