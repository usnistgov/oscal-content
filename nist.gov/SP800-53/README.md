# NIST maintained OSCAL content for NIST Special Publication 800-53

NIST is maintaining OSCAL content for multiple revisions of the NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53. The XML, JSON, and YAML versions of SP800-53 given here are derived from the NIST publications. These OSCAL files are intended to faithfully to represent the published documents in machinable readable form.

OSCAL XML-, JSON-, and YAML-based content is provided for the following revisions:

- NIST [SP 800-53 Revision 4][sp800-53-rev4] OSCAL catalog and baseline profiles [content][sp800-53-rev4-oscal].
- NIST [SP 800-53 Revision 5][sp800-53-rev5] Final OSCAL catalog and [SP 800-53B][sp800-53B] (draft) baseline [content][sp800-53-rev5-oscal].

    Note: In the SP 800-53 Revision 5, the control catalog and control baselines are separated. The control baselines are published as [SP 800-53B][sp800-53B] (draft).

    Please refer to the [publication announcement][sp800-53-rev5-announcement] for more information.

The OSCAL XML, JSON, and YAML variants are all equivalent in their information content. These variants are provided to support tooling on different format-specific implementation stacks.
