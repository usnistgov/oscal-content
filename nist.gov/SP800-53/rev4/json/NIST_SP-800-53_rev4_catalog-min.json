Some of the account management requirements listed above can be implemented\n               by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the\n               information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the\n               requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring\n               administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny\n               by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner,\n               or chief information security officer) responsible for approving such accounts and\n               privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other\n               attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes\n               required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day,\n               day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations\n               consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades)\n               and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer\n               requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider\n               these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency\n               accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary\n               accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for\n               short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation.\n               Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with\n               the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may\n               bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are\n               not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used\n               for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are\n               unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic\n               disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts\n               include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no\n               longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types\n               of information system accounts may require specialized training.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-5","rel":"related","text":"AC-5"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-10","rel":"related","text":"AC-10"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ac-19","rel":"related","text":"AC-19"},{"href":"#ac-20","rel":"related","text":"AC-20"},{"href":"#au-9","rel":"related","text":"AU-9"},{"href":"#ia-2","rel":"related","text":"IA-2"},{"href":"#ia-4","rel":"related","text":"IA-4"},{"href":"#ia-5","rel":"related","text":"IA-5"},{"href":"#ia-8","rel":"related","text":"IA-8"},{"href":"#cm-5","rel":"related","text":"CM-5"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cm-11","rel":"related","text":"CM-11"},{"href":"#ma-3","rel":"related","text":"MA-3"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related","text":"MA-4"},{"href":"#ma-5","rel":"related","text":"MA-5"},{"href":"#pl-4","rel":"related","text":"PL-4"},{"href":"#sc-13","rel":"related","text":"SC-13"}]},{"id":"ac-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

employ static\n                  information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges, dynamic access\n                  control approaches (e.g., service-oriented architectures) rely on run time access\n                  control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management. While user\n                  identities may remain relatively constant over time, user privileges may change\n                  more frequently based on ongoing mission/business requirements and operational\n                  needs of organizations. Dynamic privilege management can include, for example, the\n                  immediate revocation of privileges from users, as opposed to requiring that users\n                  terminate and restart their sessions to reflect any changes in privileges. Dynamic\n                  privilege management can also refer to mechanisms that change the privileges of\n                  users based on dynamic rules as opposed to editing specific user profiles. This\n                  type of privilege management includes, for example, automatic adjustments of\n                  privileges if users are operating out of their normal work times, or if\n                  information systems are under duress or in emergency maintenance situations. This\n                  control enhancement also includes the ancillary effects of privilege changes, for\n                  example, the potential changes to encryption keys used for communications.

The above class of\n                  mandatory access control policies constrains what actions subjects can take with\n                  information obtained from data objects for which they have already been granted\n                  access, thus preventing the subjects from passing the information to unauthorized\n                  subjects and objects. This class of mandatory access control policies also\n                  constrains what actions subjects can take with respect to the propagation of\n                  access control privileges; that is, a subject with a privilege cannot pass that\n                  privilege to other subjects. The policy is uniformly enforced over all subjects\n                  and objects to which the information system has control. Otherwise, the access\n                  control policy can be circumvented. This enforcement typically is provided via an\n                  implementation that meets the reference monitor concept (see AC-25). The policy is\n                  bounded by the information system boundary (i.e., once the information is passed\n                  outside of the control of the system, additional means may be required to ensure\n                  that the constraints on the information remain in effect). The trusted subjects\n                  described above are granted privileges consistent with the concept of least\n                  privilege (see AC-6). Trusted subjects are only given the minimum privileges\n                  relative to the above policy necessary for satisfying organizational\n                  mission/business needs. The control is most applicable when there is some policy\n                  mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that establishes a\n                  policy regarding access to sensitive/classified information and some users of the\n                  information system are not authorized access to all sensitive/classified\n                  information resident in the information system. This control can operate in\n                  conjunction with AC-3 (4). A subject that is constrained in its operation by\n                  policies governed by this control is still able to operate under the less rigorous\n                  constraints of AC-3 (4), but policies governed by this control take precedence\n                  over the less rigorous constraints of AC-3 (4). For example, while a mandatory\n                  access control policy imposes a constraint preventing a subject from passing\n                  information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity label, AC-3\n                  (4) permits the subject to pass the information to any subject with the same\n                  sensitivity label as the subject.","links":[{"href":"#ac-25","rel":"related","text":"AC-25"},{"href":"#sc-11","rel":"related","text":"SC-11"}]},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[1]"}],"prose":"the organization defines mandatory access control policies to be enforced over\n                     all subjects and objects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[2]"}],"prose":"the organization defines subjects over which organization-defined mandatory\n                     access control policies are to be enforced;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[3]"}],"prose":"the organization defines objects over which organization-defined mandatory\n                     access control policies are to be enforced;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.4","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[4]"}],"prose":"the organization defines subjects that may explicitly be granted privileges\n                     such that they are not limited by the constraints specified elsewhere within\n                     this control;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.5","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[5]"}],"prose":"the organization defines privileges that may be granted to organization-defined\n                     subjects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6]"}],"prose":"the information system enforces organization-defined mandatory access control\n                     policies over all subjects and objects where the policy specifies that:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3.a_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](a)"}],"prose":"the policy is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the\n                        boundary of the information system;","links":[{"href":"#ac-3.3_smt.a","rel":"corresp","text":"AC-3(3)(a)"}]},{"id":"ac-3.3.b_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)"}],"prose":"a subject that has been granted access to information is constrained from\n                        doing any of the following:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3.b.1_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(1)"}],"prose":"passing the information to unauthorized subjects or objects;","links":[{"href":"#ac-3.3_smt.b.1","rel":"corresp","text":"AC-3(3)(b)(1)"}]},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.2_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(2)"}],"prose":"granting its privileges to other subjects;","links":[{"href":"#ac-3.3_smt.b.2","rel":"corresp","text":"AC-3(3)(b)(2)"}]},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)"}],"prose":"changing one or more security attributes on:","parts":[{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)[a]"}],"prose":"subjects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)[b]"}],"prose":"objects;"},{"id":"ac-3.3.b.3_obj.6.c","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-3(3)[6](b)(3)[c]"}],"prose":"the information system;

Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping\n               export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet,\n               blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting\n               web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and\n               limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and\n               content. Transferring information between information systems representing different\n               security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers\n               violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information\n               owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between\n               interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural\n               solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes,\n               for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems\n               (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way\n               information flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to\n               reassign security attributes and security labels. Organizations commonly employ\n               information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of\n               information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals,\n               and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow\n               control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information\n               path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g.,\n               gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or\n               establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a\n               packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering\n               capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using\n               document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of\n               filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components)\n               that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 22\n               primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering\n               techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented\n               in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards.

Internal data structures can represent different types of\n               entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are\n               typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of\n               individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with\n               data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and\n               communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions\n               representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities\n               with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with\n               active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive\n               information, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the information\n               system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e.,\n               objects) that contain or receive information. The association of security attributes\n               to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of\n               setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to\n               data/information, enables the enforcement of information security policies for access\n               control and information flow control, either through organizational processes or\n               information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned values of\n               security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access\n               organizational information. Organizations can define the types of attributes needed\n               for selected information systems to support missions/business functions. There is\n               potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security\n               attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not\n               releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and\n               values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful\n               and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the association of security\n               attributes with subjects and objects represented by internal data structures within\n               organizational information systems, to enable information system-based enforcement of\n               information security policies. Security labels include, for example, access\n               authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration),\n               nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in\n               accordance with legal and compliance requirements. The term security marking refers\n               to the association of security attributes with objects in a human-readable form, to\n               enable organizational process-based enforcement of information security policies. The\n               AC-16 base control represents the requirement for user-based attribute association\n               (marking). The enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements including\n               information system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes\n               include, for example, classification level for objects and clearance (access\n               authorization) level for subjects. An example of a value for both of these attribute\n               types is Top Secret.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-21","rel":"related","text":"AC-21"},{"href":"#au-2","rel":"related","text":"AU-2"},{"href":"#au-10","rel":"related","text":"AU-10"},{"href":"#sc-16","rel":"related","text":"SC-16"},{"href":"#mp-3","rel":"related","text":"MP-3"}]},{"id":"ac-16_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"ac-16.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"ac-16.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16(a)[1]"}],"prose":"defines types of security attributes to be associated with information:","parts":[{"id":"ac-16.a_obj.1.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16(a)[1][a]"}],"prose":"in storage;"},{"id":"ac-16.a_obj.1.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AC-16(a)[1][b]"}],"prose":"in process;

External information systems include, for example: (i) personally\n               owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets,\n               personal digital assistants); (ii) privately owned computing and communications\n               devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations,\n               convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); (iii) information systems owned or\n               controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and (iv) federal information\n               systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and\n               authority of organizations. This control also addresses the use of external\n               information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of organizational\n               information, including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure\n               as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational\n               information systems. For some external information systems (i.e., information systems\n               operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those\n               agencies), the trust relationships that have been established between those\n               organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms\n               and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations would not\n               be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are\n               pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established\n               between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such\n               trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or\n               policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel,\n               contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational\n               information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose rules\n               of behavior with regard to system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on\n               authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending\n               upon the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may\n               choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local,\n               or tribal governments. This control does not apply to the use of external information\n               systems to access public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g.,\n               individuals accessing federal information through www.usa.gov). Organizations\n               establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in\n               accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions\n               address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational\n               information systems from external information systems; and the highest security\n               category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external\n               information systems.

Audit events can\n               include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to\n               information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or\n               third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events,\n               organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to\n               be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs,\n               this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are\n               audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that\n               information systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful\n               and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances\n               due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including\n               the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and\n               control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required\n               by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and\n               standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including\n               at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate\n               level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate\n               the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the\n               definition of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such\n               as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are\n               distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented\n               architectures.","links":[{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#au-3","rel":"related","text":"AU-3"},{"href":"#au-12","rel":"related","text":"AU-12"},{"href":"#ma-4","rel":"related","text":"MA-4"},{"href":"#mp-2","rel":"related","text":"MP-2"},{"href":"#mp-4","rel":"related","text":"MP-4"},{"href":"#si-4","rel":"related","text":"SI-4"}]},{"id":"au-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"au-2.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-2.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the auditable events that the information system must be capable of\n                     auditing;"},{"id":"au-2.a_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(a)[2]"}],"prose":"determines that the information system is capable of auditing\n                     organization-defined auditable events;"}]},{"id":"au-2.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(b)"}],"prose":"coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities\n                  requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide\n                  the selection of auditable events;"},{"id":"au-2.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(c)"}],"prose":"provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to\n                  support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents;"},{"id":"au-2.d_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-2.d_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the subset of auditable events defined in AU-2a that are to be audited\n                     within the information system;"},{"id":"au-2.d_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-2(d)[2]"}],"prose":"determines that the subset of auditable events defined in AU-2a are to be\n                     audited within the information system;

Organizations may define different time\n               granularities for different system components. Time service can also be critical to\n               other security capabilities such as access control and identification and\n               authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support those\n               capabilities.","links":[{"href":"#au-3","rel":"related","text":"AU-3"},{"href":"#au-12","rel":"related","text":"AU-12"}]},{"id":"au-8_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if:","parts":[{"id":"au-8.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-8(a)"}],"prose":"the information system uses internal system clocks to generate time stamps for\n                  audit records;"},{"id":"au-8.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-8(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"au-8.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-8(b)[1]"}],"prose":"the information system records time stamps for audit records that can be mapped\n                     to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT);"},{"id":"au-8.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"AU-8(b)[2]"}],"prose":"the organization defines the granularity of time measurement to be met when\n                     recording time stamps for audit records;

Security assessments: (i) ensure\n               that information security is built into organizational information systems; (ii)\n               identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; (iii) provide\n               essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of security\n               authorization processes; and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation\n               procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from\n               Appendix F (main catalog) and Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented\n               in System Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can\n               use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system\n               monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems during the entire\n               life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient\n               detail as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and\n               completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented\n               correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to\n               meeting security requirements. The FISMA requirement for assessing security controls\n               at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those\n               activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes.\n               Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for\n               the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in\n               support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or\n               authorizing official designated representatives. To satisfy annual assessment\n               requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources:\n               (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring;\n               or (iii) system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security\n               assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control\n               effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence.\n               Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the\n               results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as\n               needed. Subsequent to initial authorizations and in accordance with OMB policy,\n               organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations\n               establish the frequency for ongoing security control assessments in accordance with\n               organizational continuous monitoring strategies.

Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for\n               organizational information systems or assume responsibility for the mission/business\n               operations supported by those systems. The security authorization process is an\n               inherently federal responsibility and therefore, authorizing officials must be\n               federal employees. Through the security authorization process, authorizing officials\n               assume responsibility and are accountable for security risks associated with the\n               operation and use of organizational information systems.

Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes,\n               critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security plans,\n               security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an\n               ongoing basis, providing authorizing officials and information system owners with an\n               up-to-date status of the security state of organizational information systems and\n               environments of operation. To reduce the administrative cost of security\n               reauthorization, authorizing officials use the results of continuous monitoring\n               processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization\n               decisions.","links":[{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"related","text":"CA-2"},{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related","text":"CA-7"},{"href":"#pm-9","rel":"related","text":"PM-9"},{"href":"#pm-10","rel":"related","text":"PM-10"}]},{"id":"ca-6_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"ca-6.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(a)"}],"prose":"assigns a senior-level executive or manager as the authorizing official for the\n                  information system;"},{"id":"ca-6.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(b)"}],"prose":"ensures that the authorizing official authorizes the information system for\n                  processing before commencing operations;"},{"id":"ca-6.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(c)"}],"parts":[{"id":"ca-6.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CA-6(c)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency to update the security authorization;

changed in hardware,\n               software, or firmware components of the information system that affect the security\n               posture and/or functionality of the system. Information technology products for which\n               security-related configuration settings can be defined include, for example,\n               mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web,\n               proxy, file, domain name), workstations, input/output devices (e.g., scanners,\n               copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice\n               and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating\n               systems, middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those\n               parameters impacting the security state of information systems including the\n               parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related\n               parameters include, for example: (i) registry settings; (ii) account, file, directory\n               permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports, protocols, services,\n               and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration\n               settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The\n               established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. Common secure\n               configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and\n               hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation\n               guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate\n               secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products\n               and instructions for configuring those information system components to meet\n               operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety\n               of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers,\n               manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other\n               organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include\n               the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) which affects the\n               implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security\n               Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol\n               (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely\n               identify, track, and control configuration settings.

Organizations consider disabling unused\n               or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File\n               Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to\n               prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or\n               unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion\n               detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and\n               host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited\n               functions, ports, protocols, and services.","links":[{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related","text":"CM-2"},{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"related","text":"RA-5"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related","text":"SA-5"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"}]},{"id":"cm-7_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"cm-7.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(a)"}],"prose":"configures the information system to provide only essential capabilities;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines prohibited or restricted:","parts":[{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1][a]"}],"prose":"functions;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1][b]"}],"prose":"ports;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1.c","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1][c]"}],"prose":"protocols; and/or"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.1.d","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[1][d]"}],"prose":"services;"}]},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[2]"}],"prose":"prohibits or restricts the use of organization-defined:","parts":[{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.2.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[2][a]"}],"prose":"functions;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.2.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[2][b]"}],"prose":"ports;"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.2.c","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[2][c]"}],"prose":"protocols; and/or"},{"id":"cm-7.b_obj.2.d","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(b)[2][d]"}],"prose":"services."}]}]}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Configuration management policy\\n\\nconfiguration management plan\\n\\nprocedures addressing least functionality in the information system\\n\\nsecurity plan\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\nsecurity configuration checklists\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with security configuration management\n                  responsibilities\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem/network administrators"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational processes prohibiting or restricting functions, ports, protocols,\n                  and/or services\\n\\nautomated mechanisms implementing restrictions or prohibition of functions, ports,\n                  protocols, and/or services"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"cm-7.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Periodic Review","parameters":[{"id":"cm-7.1_prm_1","label":"organization-defined frequency"},{"id":"cm-7.1_prm_2","label":"organization-defined functions, ports, protocols, and services within the\n                  information system deemed to be unnecessary and/or nonsecure"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"CM-7(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"cm-07.01"}],"parts":[{"id":"cm-7.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization:","parts":[{"id":"cm-7.1_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(a)"}],"prose":"Reviews the information system {{ cm-7.1_prm_1 }} to identify\n                     unnecessary and/or nonsecure functions, ports, protocols, and services; and"},{"id":"cm-7.1_smt.b","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(b)"}],"prose":"Disables {{ cm-7.1_prm_2 }}."}]},{"id":"cm-7.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"The organization can either make a determination of the relative security of the\n                  function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the\n                  assessment of other entities.

By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident\n               handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning\n               activities are in place

This control\n               applies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and\n               documented in AC-14; and (ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group\n               authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique\n               identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or\n               for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords,\n               tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case multifactor\n               authentication, or some combination thereof. Access to organizational information\n               systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any\n               access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf\n               of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of\n               networks. Network access is access to organizational information systems by users (or\n               processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network\n               connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that\n               involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal\n               networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of\n               encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) for network connections between\n               organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be\n               treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality\n               and integrity of information traversing the network. Organizations can satisfy the\n               identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the\n               requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the\n               specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the\n               use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are\n               defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number\n               [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token);\n               or (iii) something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor solutions that require\n               devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example,\n               hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart\n               cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD\n               common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the\n               information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification\n               and authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide\n               increased information security.

Effective\n               incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities\n               including, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners,\n               authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security\n               offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk\n               executive (function).","links":[{"href":"#au-6","rel":"related","text":"AU-6"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#cp-2","rel":"related","text":"CP-2"},{"href":"#cp-4","rel":"related","text":"CP-4"},{"href":"#ir-2","rel":"related","text":"IR-2"},{"href":"#ir-3","rel":"related","text":"IR-3"},{"href":"#ir-8","rel":"related","text":"IR-8"},{"href":"#pe-6","rel":"related","text":"PE-6"},{"href":"#sc-5","rel":"related","text":"SC-5"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#si-3","rel":"related","text":"SI-3"},{"href":"#si-4","rel":"related","text":"SI-4"},{"href":"#si-7","rel":"related","text":"SI-7"}]},{"id":"ir-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"ir-4.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(a)"}],"prose":"implements an incident handling capability for security incidents that\n                  includes:","parts":[{"id":"ir-4.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(a)[1]"}],"prose":"preparation;"},{"id":"ir-4.a_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(a)[2]"}],"prose":"detection and analysis;"},{"id":"ir-4.a_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(a)[3]"}],"prose":"containment;"},{"id":"ir-4.a_obj.4","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(a)[4]"}],"prose":"eradication;"},{"id":"ir-4.a_obj.5","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(a)[5]"}],"prose":"recovery;"}]},{"id":"ir-4.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(b)"}],"prose":"coordinates incident handling activities with contingency planning activities;"},{"id":"ir-4.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(c)"}],"parts":[{"id":"ir-4.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(c)[1]"}],"prose":"incorporates lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities\n                     into:","parts":[{"id":"ir-4.c_obj.1.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(c)[1][a]"}],"prose":"incident response procedures;"},{"id":"ir-4.c_obj.1.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(c)[1][b]"}],"prose":"training;"},{"id":"ir-4.c_obj.1.c","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(c)[1][c]"}],"prose":"testing/exercises;"}]},{"id":"ir-4.c_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(c)[2]"}],"prose":"implements the resulting changes accordingly to:","parts":[{"id":"ir-4.c_obj.2.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(c)[2][a]"}],"prose":"incident response procedures;"},{"id":"ir-4.c_obj.2.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(c)[2][b]"}],"prose":"training; and"},{"id":"ir-4.c_obj.2.c","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(c)[2][c]"}],"prose":"testing/exercises."}]}]}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Incident response policy\\n\\ncontingency planning policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing incident handling\\n\\nincident response plan\\n\\ncontingency plan\\n\\nsecurity plan\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with incident handling responsibilities\\n\\norganizational personnel with contingency planning responsibilities\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Incident handling capability for the organization"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"ir-4.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Automated Incident Handling Processes","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"IR-4(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ir-04.01"}],"parts":[{"id":"ir-4.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the incident handling\n                  process."},{"id":"ir-4.1_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Automated mechanisms supporting incident handling processes include, for example,\n                  online incident management systems."},{"id":"ir-4.1_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization employs automated mechanisms to support the incident\n                  handling process.

Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part by\n               other controls.","links":[{"href":"#ac-2","rel":"related","text":"AC-2"},{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-6","rel":"related","text":"AC-6"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#au-2","rel":"related","text":"AU-2"},{"href":"#au-3","rel":"related","text":"AU-3"},{"href":"#ia-2","rel":"related","text":"IA-2"},{"href":"#ia-4","rel":"related","text":"IA-4"},{"href":"#ia-5","rel":"related","text":"IA-5"},{"href":"#ia-8","rel":"related","text":"IA-8"},{"href":"#ma-2","rel":"related","text":"MA-2"},{"href":"#ma-5","rel":"related","text":"MA-5"},{"href":"#mp-6","rel":"related","text":"MP-6"},{"href":"#pl-2","rel":"related","text":"PL-2"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#sc-10","rel":"related","text":"SC-10"},{"href":"#sc-17","rel":"related","text":"SC-17"}]},{"id":"ma-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization: ","parts":[{"id":"ma-4.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"ma-4.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(a)[1]"}],"prose":"approves nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;"},{"id":"ma-4.a_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(a)[2]"}],"prose":"monitors nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;"}]},{"id":"ma-4.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(b)"}],"prose":"allows the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only:","parts":[{"id":"ma-4.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(b)[1]"}],"prose":"as consistent with organizational policy;"},{"id":"ma-4.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(b)[2]"}],"prose":"as documented in the security plan for the information system;"}]},{"id":"ma-4.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(c)"}],"prose":"employs strong authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and\n                  diagnostic sessions;"},{"id":"ma-4.d_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(d)"}],"prose":"maintains records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;"},{"id":"ma-4.e_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(e)"}],"parts":[{"id":"ma-4.e_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(e)[1]"}],"prose":"terminates sessions when nonlocal maintenance or diagnostics is completed;\n                     and"},{"id":"ma-4.e_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(e)[2]"}],"prose":"terminates network connections when nonlocal maintenance or diagnostics is\n                     completed."}]}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Information system maintenance policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing nonlocal information system maintenance\\n\\nsecurity plan\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\nmaintenance records\\n\\ndiagnostic records\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with information system maintenance responsibilities\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem/network administrators"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational processes for managing nonlocal maintenance\\n\\nautomated mechanisms implementing, supporting, and/or managing nonlocal\n                  maintenance\\n\\nautomated mechanisms for strong authentication of nonlocal maintenance diagnostic\n                  sessions\\n\\nautomated mechanisms for terminating nonlocal maintenance sessions and network\n                  connections"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"ma-4.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Auditing and Review","parameters":[{"id":"ma-4.1_prm_1","label":"organization-defined audit events"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"MA-4(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"ma-04.01"}],"parts":[{"id":"ma-4.1_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization:","parts":[{"id":"ma-4.1_smt.a","name":"item","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"(a)"}],"prose":"Audits nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions {{ ma-4.1_prm_1 }};

Security plans contain sufficient information (including\n               the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either\n               explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is\n               unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of\n               risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and\n               the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply\n               tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in Appendix D and CNSS\n               Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized\n               requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g.,\n               DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and\n               Access Management, space operations).

The information security architecture at the individual\n               information system level is consistent with and complements the more global,\n               organization-wide information security architecture described in PM-7 that is\n               integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information\n               security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation\n               of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information\n               for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the\n               protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security\n               architecture can include other important security-related information, for example,\n               user roles and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements,\n               the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information\n               system, restoration priorities of information and information system services, and\n               any other specific protection needs. In today’s modern architecture, it is becoming\n               less common for organizations to control all information resources. There are going\n               to be key dependencies on external information services and service providers.\n               Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to\n               developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing,\n               developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline\n               configuration for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and\n               maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of the\n               information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for\n               Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to\n               support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is\n               primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that\n               organizations develop an information security architecture for the information\n               system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to\n               the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security\n               architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information\n               technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used\n               internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, which is\n               complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of\n               information systems or information system components to external entities, and there\n               is a need to demonstrate/show consistency with the organization’s enterprise\n               architecture and information security architecture.","links":[{"href":"#cm-2","rel":"related","text":"CM-2"},{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#pl-2","rel":"related","text":"PL-2"},{"href":"#pm-7","rel":"related","text":"PM-7"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related","text":"SA-5"},{"href":"#sa-17","rel":"related","text":"SA-17"},{"href":"https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r4","rel":"related","text":"Appendix J"}]},{"id":"pl-8_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization: ","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)"}],"prose":"develops an information security architecture for the information system that\n                  describes:","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.a.1_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(1)"}],"prose":"the overall philosophy, requirements, and approach to be taken with regard to\n                     protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational\n                     information;"},{"id":"pl-8.a.2_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(2)"}],"prose":"how the information security architecture is integrated into and supports the\n                     enterprise architecture;"},{"id":"pl-8.a.3_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(a)(3)"}],"prose":"any information security assumptions about, and dependencies on, external\n                     services;"}]},{"id":"pl-8.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"pl-8.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency to review and update the information security\n                     architecture;"},{"id":"pl-8.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(b)[2]"}],"prose":"reviews and updates the information security architecture with the\n                     organization-defined frequency to reflect updates in the enterprise\n                     architecture;"}]},{"id":"pl-8.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)"}],"prose":"ensures that planned information security architecture changes are reflected\n                  in:","parts":[{"id":"pl-8.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)[1]"}],"prose":"the security plan;"},{"id":"pl-8.c_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PL-8(c)[2]"}],"prose":"the security Concept of Operations (CONOPS);

Security assurance requirements include: (i) development processes,\n               procedures, practices, and methodologies; and (ii) evidence from development and\n               assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security\n               functionality has been implemented and the required security strength has been\n               achieved. Security documentation requirements address all phases of the system\n               development life cycle. Security functionality, assurance, and documentation\n               requirements are expressed in terms of security controls and control enhancements\n               that have been selected through the tailoring process. The security control tailoring\n               process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values through the use\n               of assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform dependencies\n               and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and\n               administrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security\n               controls. The level of detail required in security documentation is based on the\n               security category or classification level of the information system and the degree to\n               which organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions, or\n               mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the\n               organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include\n               organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports,\n               protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information\n               system components, and information system services are defined in the same manner as\n               such criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement. The Federal\n               Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information security requirements\n               from FISMA.","links":[{"href":"#cm-6","rel":"related","text":"CM-6"},{"href":"#pl-2","rel":"related","text":"PL-2"},{"href":"#ps-7","rel":"related","text":"PS-7"},{"href":"#sa-3","rel":"related","text":"SA-3"},{"href":"#sa-5","rel":"related","text":"SA-5"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related","text":"SA-8"},{"href":"#sa-11","rel":"related","text":"SA-11"},{"href":"#sa-12","rel":"related","text":"SA-12"}]},{"id":"sa-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

Trust relationships can help\n                  organization to gain increased levels of confidence that participating service\n                  providers are providing adequate protection for the services rendered. Such\n                  relationships can be complicated due to the number of potential entities\n                  participating in the consumer-provider interactions, subordinate relationships and\n                  levels of trust, and the types of interactions between the parties. In some cases,\n                  the degree of trust is based on the amount of direct control organizations are\n                  able to exert on external service providers with regard to employment of security\n                  controls necessary for the protection of the service/information and the evidence\n                  brought forth as to the effectiveness of those controls. The level of control is\n                  typically established by the terms and conditions of the contracts or\n                  service-level agreements and can range from extensive control (e.g., negotiating\n                  contracts or agreements that specify security requirements for the providers) to\n                  very limited control (e.g., using contracts or service-level agreements to obtain\n                  commodity services such as commercial telecommunications services). In other\n                  cases, levels of trust are based on factors that convince organizations that\n                  required security controls have been employed and that determinations of control\n                  effectiveness exist. For example, separately authorized external information\n                  system services provided to organizations through well-established business\n                  relationships may provide degrees of trust in such services within the tolerable\n                  risk range of the organizations using the services. External service providers may\n                  also outsource selected services to other external entities, making the trust\n                  relationship more difficult and complicated to manage. Depending on the nature of\n                  the services, organizations may find it very difficult to place significant trust\n                  in external providers. This is not due to any inherent untrustworthiness on the\n                  part of providers, but to the intrinsic level of risk in the services."},{"id":"sa-9.3_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"sa-9.3_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-9(3)[1]"}],"prose":"defines requirements, properties, factors, or conditions defining acceptable\n                     trust relationships;"},{"id":"sa-9.3_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-9(3)[2]"}],"prose":"based on organization-defined requirements, properties, factors, or conditions\n                     defining acceptable trust relationships:","parts":[{"id":"sa-9.3_obj.2.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-9(3)[2][a]"}],"prose":"establishes trust relationships with external service providers;"},{"id":"sa-9.3_obj.2.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-9(3)[2][b]"}],"prose":"documents trust relationships with external service providers; and"},{"id":"sa-9.3_obj.2.c","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-9(3)[2][c]"}],"prose":"maintains trust relationships with external service providers."}]}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System and services acquisition policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing external information system services\\n\\nacquisition contracts for the information system, system component, or\n                     information system service\\n\\nacquisition documentation\\n\\nsolicitation documentation\\n\\nservice-level agreements\\n\\norganizational security requirements, properties, factors, or conditions\n                     defining acceptable trust relationships\\n\\ndocumentation of trust relationships with external service providers\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with system and services acquisition\n                     responsibilities\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nexternal providers of information system services"}]}]},{"id":"sa-9.4","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Consistent Interests of Consumers and Providers","parameters":[{"id":"sa-9.4_prm_1","label":"organization-defined security safeguards"},{"id":"sa-9.4_prm_2","label":"organization-defined external service providers"}],"properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SA-9(4)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"sa-09.04"}],"parts":[{"id":"sa-9.4_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization employs {{ sa-9.4_prm_1 }} to ensure that the\n                  interests of {{ sa-9.4_prm_2 }} are consistent with and reflect\n                  organizational interests."},{"id":"sa-9.4_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"As organizations increasingly use external service providers, the possibility\n                  exists that the interests of the service providers may diverge from organizational\n                  interests.

Depending on the\n               mission/business needs of organizations and the nature of the contractual\n               relationships in place, developers may provide configuration management support\n               during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle.","links":[{"href":"#cm-3","rel":"related","text":"CM-3"},{"href":"#cm-4","rel":"related","text":"CM-4"},{"href":"#cm-9","rel":"related","text":"CM-9"},{"href":"#sa-12","rel":"related","text":"SA-12"},{"href":"#si-2","rel":"related","text":"SI-2"}]},{"id":"sa-10_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

Security\n               properties of information systems may be affected by the interconnection of system\n               components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes (e.g.,\n               upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may adversely affect\n               previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional types of\n               security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate\n               potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as\n               static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three\n               approaches. Developers can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools\n               (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and\n               in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the specific activities\n               that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing,\n               evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to\n               be applied, and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of\n               security testing/evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with\n               the assessment process (e.g., black box, gray box, or white box testing). The\n               coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type)\n               of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance\n               criteria for security assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence\n               that the plans/processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and\n               protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the\n               security category or classification level of the information system.

Trustworthiness is a\n               characteristic/property of an information system that expresses the degree to which\n               the system can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and\n               availability of the information it processes, stores, or transmits. Trustworthy\n               information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within\n               defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and\n               purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified environments of\n               operation. Trustworthy systems are important to mission/business success. Two factors\n               affecting the trustworthiness of information systems include: (i) security\n               functionality (i.e., the security features, functions, and/or mechanisms employed\n               within the system and its environment of operation); and (ii) security assurance\n               (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its\n               application). Developers, implementers, operators, and maintainers of organizational\n               information systems can increase the level of assurance (and trustworthiness), for\n               example, by employing well-defined security policy models, structured and rigorous\n               hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound system/security\n               engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of\n               assurance-related security controls in Appendix E). Assurance is also based on the\n               assessment of evidence produced during the system development life cycle. Critical\n               missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the associated\n               assurance requirements for such systems.

Such transmission\n               services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security\n               provisions.","links":[{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#ca-3","rel":"related","text":"CA-3"},{"href":"#cm-7","rel":"related","text":"CM-7"},{"href":"#cp-8","rel":"related","text":"CP-8"},{"href":"#ir-4","rel":"related","text":"IR-4"},{"href":"#ra-3","rel":"related","text":"RA-3"},{"href":"#sc-5","rel":"related","text":"SC-5"},{"href":"#sc-13","rel":"related","text":"SC-13"}]},{"id":"sc-7_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the information system:","parts":[{"id":"sc-7.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"sc-7.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(a)[1]"}],"prose":"monitors communications at the external boundary of the information system;"},{"id":"sc-7.a_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(a)[2]"}],"prose":"monitors communications at key internal boundaries within the system;"},{"id":"sc-7.a_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(a)[3]"}],"prose":"controls communications at the external boundary of the information system;"},{"id":"sc-7.a_obj.4","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(a)[4]"}],"prose":"controls communications at key internal boundaries within the system;"}]},{"id":"sc-7.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(b)"}],"prose":"implements subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are\n                  either:","parts":[{"id":"sc-7.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(b)[1]"}],"prose":"physically separated from internal organizational networks; and/or"},{"id":"sc-7.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(b)[2]"}],"prose":"logically separated from internal organizational networks; and"}]},{"id":"sc-7.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(c)"}],"prose":"connects to external networks or information systems only through managed\n                  interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with\n                  an organizational security architecture."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System and communications protection policy\\n\\nprocedures addressing boundary protection\\n\\nlist of key internal boundaries of the information system\\n\\ninformation system design documentation\\n\\nboundary protection hardware and software\\n\\ninformation system configuration settings and associated documentation\\n\\nenterprise security architecture documentation\\n\\ninformation system audit records\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"System/network administrators\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities\\n\\nsystem developer\\n\\norganizational personnel with boundary protection responsibilities"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Automated mechanisms implementing boundary protection capability"}]}],"controls":[{"id":"sc-7.1","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Physically Separated Subnetworks","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(1)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"sc-07.01"},{"name":"status","value":"Withdrawn"}],"links":[{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"incorporated-into","text":"SC-7"}]},{"id":"sc-7.2","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Public Access","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(2)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"sc-07.02"},{"name":"status","value":"Withdrawn"}],"links":[{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"incorporated-into","text":"SC-7"}]},{"id":"sc-7.3","class":"SP800-53-enhancement","title":"Access Points","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SC-7(3)"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"sc-07.03"}],"parts":[{"id":"sc-7.3_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization limits the number of external network connections to the\n                  information system."},{"id":"sc-7.3_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates more comprehensive\n                  monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic.

Security-relevant software updates include, for example, patches,\n               service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations also address flaws\n               discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response\n               activities, and system error handling. Organizations take advantage of available\n               resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and\n               Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational\n               information systems.

Organization-defined time periods for updating\n               security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors\n               including, for example, the security category of the information system or the\n               criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the\n               discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other\n               types. Organizations determine the degree and type of testing needed for the specific\n               type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and also the types of changes\n               that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may determine\n               that the testing of software and/or firmware updates is not necessary or practical,\n               for example, when implementing simple anti-virus signature updates. Organizations may\n               also consider in testing decisions, whether security-relevant software or firmware\n               updates are obtained from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures.","links":[{"href":"#ca-2","rel":"related","text":"CA-2"},{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related","text":"CA-7"},{"href":"#cm-3","rel":"related","text":"CM-3"},{"href":"#cm-5","rel":"related","text":"CM-5"},{"href":"#cm-8","rel":"related","text":"CM-8"},{"href":"#ma-2","rel":"related","text":"MA-2"},{"href":"#ir-4","rel":"related","text":"IR-4"},{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"related","text":"RA-5"},{"href":"#sa-10","rel":"related","text":"SA-10"},{"href":"#sa-11","rel":"related","text":"SA-11"},{"href":"#si-11","rel":"related","text":"SI-11"}]},{"id":"si-2_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"si-2.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(a)"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-2.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(a)[1]"}],"prose":"identifies information system flaws;"},{"id":"si-2.a_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(a)[2]"}],"prose":"reports information system flaws;"},{"id":"si-2.a_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(a)[3]"}],"prose":"corrects information system flaws;"}]},{"id":"si-2.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-2.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(b)[1]"}],"prose":"tests software updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and\n                     potential side effects before installation;"},{"id":"si-2.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(b)[2]"}],"prose":"tests firmware updates related to flaw remediation for effectiveness and\n                     potential side effects before installation;"}]},{"id":"si-2.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(c)"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-2.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(c)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the time period within which to install security-relevant software\n                     updates after the release of the updates;"},{"id":"si-2.c_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(c)[2]"}],"prose":"defines the time period within which to install security-relevant firmware\n                     updates after the release of the updates;"},{"id":"si-2.c_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(c)[3]"}],"prose":"installs software updates within the organization-defined time period of the\n                     release of the updates;"},{"id":"si-2.c_obj.4","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-2(c)[4]"}],"prose":"installs firmware updates within the organization-defined time period of the\n                     release of the updates;

For example, organizations can define actions in\n               response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to\n               detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions in response to detection of\n               maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.","links":[{"href":"#cm-3","rel":"related","text":"CM-3"},{"href":"#mp-2","rel":"related","text":"MP-2"},{"href":"#sa-4","rel":"related","text":"SA-4"},{"href":"#sa-8","rel":"related","text":"SA-8"},{"href":"#sa-12","rel":"related","text":"SA-12"},{"href":"#sa-13","rel":"related","text":"SA-13"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#sc-26","rel":"related","text":"SC-26"},{"href":"#sc-44","rel":"related","text":"SC-44"},{"href":"#si-2","rel":"related","text":"SI-2"},{"href":"#si-4","rel":"related","text":"SI-4"},{"href":"#si-7","rel":"related","text":"SI-7"}]},{"id":"si-3_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"si-3.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(a)"}],"prose":"employs malicious code protection mechanisms to detect and eradicate malicious\n                  code at information system:","parts":[{"id":"si-3.a_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(a)[1]"}],"prose":"entry points;"},{"id":"si-3.a_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(a)[2]"}],"prose":"exit points;"}]},{"id":"si-3.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(b)"}],"prose":"updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are available\n                  in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures\n                  (as identified in CM-1);"},{"id":"si-3.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-3.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)[1]"}],"prose":"defines a frequency for malicious code protection mechanisms to perform\n                     periodic scans of the information system;"},{"id":"si-3.c_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)[2]"}],"prose":"defines action to be initiated by malicious protection mechanisms in response\n                     to malicious code detection;"},{"id":"si-3.c_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)[3]"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-3.c.1_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)[3](1)"}],"prose":"configures malicious code protection mechanisms to:","parts":[{"id":"si-3.c.1_obj.3.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)[3](1)[a]"}],"prose":"perform periodic scans of the information system with the\n                           organization-defined frequency;"},{"id":"si-3.c.1_obj.3.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)[3](1)[b]"}],"prose":"perform real-time scans of files from external sources at endpoint and/or\n                           network entry/exit points as the files are downloaded, opened, or\n                           executed in accordance with organizational security policy;"}]},{"id":"si-3.c.2_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)[3](2)"}],"prose":"configures malicious code protection mechanisms to do one or more of the\n                        following:","parts":[{"id":"si-3.c.2_obj.3.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)[3](2)[a]"}],"prose":"block malicious code in response to malicious code detection;"},{"id":"si-3.c.2_obj.3.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)[3](2)[b]"}],"prose":"quarantine malicious code in response to malicious code detection;"},{"id":"si-3.c.2_obj.3.c","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)[3](2)[c]"}],"prose":"send alert to administrator in response to malicious code detection;\n                           and/or"},{"id":"si-3.c.2_obj.3.d","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(c)[3](2)[d]"}],"prose":"initiate organization-defined action in response to malicious code\n                           detection;"}]}]}]},{"id":"si-3.d_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(d)"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-3.d_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-3(d)[1]"}],"prose":"addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and\n                     eradication;

External\n               monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system\n               boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal\n               monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the information\n               system. Organizations can monitor information systems, for example, by observing\n               audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access\n               patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may\n               guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is\n               achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection\n               systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning\n               tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic\n               locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations\n               and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically\n               being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17.\n               Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security can also\n               be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information\n               collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of\n               information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of\n               interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that\n               bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of\n               organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from\n               system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response\n               programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates\n               through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any\n               connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the\n               Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or\n               wireless.","links":[{"href":"#ac-3","rel":"related","text":"AC-3"},{"href":"#ac-4","rel":"related","text":"AC-4"},{"href":"#ac-8","rel":"related","text":"AC-8"},{"href":"#ac-17","rel":"related","text":"AC-17"},{"href":"#au-2","rel":"related","text":"AU-2"},{"href":"#au-6","rel":"related","text":"AU-6"},{"href":"#au-7","rel":"related","text":"AU-7"},{"href":"#au-9","rel":"related","text":"AU-9"},{"href":"#au-12","rel":"related","text":"AU-12"},{"href":"#ca-7","rel":"related","text":"CA-7"},{"href":"#ir-4","rel":"related","text":"IR-4"},{"href":"#pe-3","rel":"related","text":"PE-3"},{"href":"#ra-5","rel":"related","text":"RA-5"},{"href":"#sc-7","rel":"related","text":"SC-7"},{"href":"#sc-26","rel":"related","text":"SC-26"},{"href":"#sc-35","rel":"related","text":"SC-35"},{"href":"#si-3","rel":"related","text":"SI-3"},{"href":"#si-7","rel":"related","text":"SI-7"}]},{"id":"si-4_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine

By implementing the\n               concept of non-persistence for selected information system components, organizations\n               can provide a known state computing resource for a specific period of time that does\n               not give adversaries sufficient time on target to exploit vulnerabilities in\n               organizational information systems and the environments in which those systems\n               operate. Since the advanced persistent threat is a high-end threat with regard to\n               capability, intent, and targeting, organizations assume that over an extended period\n               of time, a percentage of cyber attacks will be successful. Non-persistent information\n               system components and services are activated as required using protected information\n               and terminated periodically or upon the end of sessions. Non-persistence increases\n               the work factor of adversaries in attempting to compromise or breach organizational\n               information systems. Non-persistent system components can be implemented, for\n               example, by periodically re-imaging components or by using a variety of common\n               virtualization techniques. Non-persistent services can be implemented using\n               virtualization techniques as part of virtual machines or as new instances of\n               processes on physical machines (either persistent or non-persistent).The benefit of\n               periodic refreshes of information system components/services is that it does not\n               require organizations to first determine whether compromises of components or\n               services have occurred (something that may often be difficult for organizations to\n               determine). The refresh of selected information system components and services occurs\n               with sufficient frequency to prevent the spread or intended impact of attacks, but\n               not with such frequency that it makes the information system unstable. In some\n               instances, refreshes of critical components and services may be done periodically in\n               order to hinder the ability of adversaries to exploit optimum windows of\n               vulnerabilities.","links":[{"href":"#sc-30","rel":"related","text":"SC-30"},{"href":"#sc-34","rel":"related","text":"SC-34"}]},{"id":"si-14_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization:","parts":[{"id":"si-14_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[1]"}],"prose":"defines non-persistent information system components and services to be\n                  implemented;"},{"id":"si-14_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[2]"}],"parts":[{"id":"si-14_obj.2.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[2][a]"}],"prose":"defines a frequency to terminate non-persistent organization-defined components\n                     and services that are initiated in a known state;"},{"id":"si-14_obj.2.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[2][b]"}],"prose":"implements non-persistent organization-defined information system components\n                     and services that are initiated in a known state and terminated one or more of\n                     the following:","parts":[{"id":"si-14_obj.2.b.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"SI-14[2][b][1]"}],"prose":"upon end of session of use;

The\n               organization-wide information security program plan will indicate which separate\n               security plans contain descriptions of common controls. Organizations have the\n               flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple\n               documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common\n               controls are included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the\n               information security program plan contains multiple documents, the organization\n               specifies in each document the organizational official or officials responsible for\n               the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the\n               respective common controls. For example, the organization may require that the\n               Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously\n               monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family when\n               such controls are not associated with a particular information system but instead,\n               support multiple information systems.","links":[{"href":"#pm-8","rel":"related","text":"PM-8"}]},{"id":"pm-1_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization: ","parts":[{"id":"pm-1.a_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)"}],"prose":"develops and disseminates an organization-wide information security program plan\n                  that:","parts":[{"id":"pm-1.a.1_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(1)"}],"parts":[{"id":"pm-1.a.1_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(1)[1]"}],"prose":"provides an overview of the requirements for the security program;"},{"id":"pm-1.a.1_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(1)[2]"}],"prose":"provides a description of the:","parts":[{"id":"pm-1.a.1_obj.2.a","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(1)[2][a]"}],"prose":"security program management controls in place or planned for meeting\n                           those requirements;"},{"id":"pm-1.a.1_obj.2.b","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(1)[2][b]"}],"prose":"common controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements;"}]}]},{"id":"pm-1.a.2_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(2)"}],"prose":"includes the identification and assignment of:","parts":[{"id":"pm-1.a.2_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(2)[1]"}],"prose":"roles;"},{"id":"pm-1.a.2_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(2)[2]"}],"prose":"responsibilities;"},{"id":"pm-1.a.2_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(2)[3]"}],"prose":"management commitment;"},{"id":"pm-1.a.2_obj.4","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(2)[4]"}],"prose":"coordination among organizational entities;"},{"id":"pm-1.a.2_obj.5","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(2)[5]"}],"prose":"compliance;"}]},{"id":"pm-1.a.3_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(3)"}],"prose":"reflects coordination among organizational entities responsible for the\n                     different aspects of information security (i.e., technical, physical,\n                     personnel, cyber-physical);"},{"id":"pm-1.a.4_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(a)(4)"}],"prose":"is approved by a senior official with responsibility and accountability for the\n                     risk being incurred to organizational operations, organizational assets,\n                     individuals, other organizations, and the Nation;"}]},{"id":"pm-1.b_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(b)"}],"parts":[{"id":"pm-1.b_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(b)[1]"}],"prose":"defines the frequency to review the security program plan for the information\n                     system;"},{"id":"pm-1.b_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(b)[2]"}],"prose":"reviews the organization-wide information security program plan with the\n                     organization-defined frequency;"}]},{"id":"pm-1.c_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(c)"}],"prose":"updates the plan to address organizational:","parts":[{"id":"pm-1.c_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(c)[1]"}],"prose":"changes identified during plan implementation;"},{"id":"pm-1.c_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(c)[2]"}],"prose":"changes identified during security control assessments;"},{"id":"pm-1.c_obj.3","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(c)[3]"}],"prose":"problems identified during plan implementation;"},{"id":"pm-1.c_obj.4","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(c)[4]"}],"prose":"problems identified during security control assessments;"}]},{"id":"pm-1.d_obj","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(d)"}],"prose":"protects the information security program plan from unauthorized:","parts":[{"id":"pm-1.d_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-1(d)[1]"}],"prose":"disclosure;

The Federal Segment Architecture Methodology\n               provides guidance on integrating information security requirements and security\n               controls into enterprise architectures.","links":[{"href":"#pl-2","rel":"related","text":"PL-2"},{"href":"#pl-8","rel":"related","text":"PL-8"},{"href":"#pm-11","rel":"related","text":"PM-11"},{"href":"#ra-2","rel":"related","text":"RA-2"},{"href":"#sa-3","rel":"related","text":"SA-3"}]},{"id":"pm-7_obj","name":"objective","prose":"Determine if the organization develops an enterprise architecture with consideration\n               for: ","parts":[{"id":"pm-7_obj.1","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-7[1]"}],"prose":"information security; and"},{"id":"pm-7_obj.2","name":"objective","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-7[2]"}],"prose":"the resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets,\n                  individuals, other organizations, and the Nation."}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"EXAMINE"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Information security program plan\\n\\nenterprise architecture documentation\\n\\nprocedures addressing enterprise architecture development\\n\\nresults of risk assessment of enterprise architecture\\n\\nother relevant documents or records"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"INTERVIEW"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational personnel with information security program planning and plan\n                  implementation responsibilities\\n\\norganizational personnel responsible for developing enterprise architecture\\n\\norganizational personnel responsible for risk assessment of enterprise\n                  architecture\\n\\norganizational personnel with information security responsibilities"}]},{"name":"assessment","properties":[{"name":"method","value":"TEST"}],"parts":[{"name":"objects","prose":"Organizational processes for enterprise architecture development\\n\\nautomated mechanisms supporting the enterprise architecture and its\n                  development"}]}]},{"id":"pm-8","class":"SP800-53","title":"Critical Infrastructure Plan","properties":[{"name":"label","value":"PM-8"},{"name":"sort-id","value":"pm-08"}],"links":[{"href":"#9680884b-55b7-4015-a5d7-dcb7392cb412","rel":"reference","text":"HSPD 7"},{"href":"#bd0c544a-57de-458c-9bbe-6ceac27867c8","rel":"reference","text":"National Infrastructure Protection Plan"}],"parts":[{"id":"pm-8_smt","name":"statement","prose":"The organization addresses information security issues in the development,\n               documentation, and updating of a critical infrastructure and key resources protection\n               plan."},{"id":"pm-8_gdn","name":"guidance","prose":"Protection strategies are based on the prioritization of critical assets and\n               resources.

The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in\n               classified environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of\n               Controlled Unclassified Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat\n               programs include security controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity\n               through the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and non-technical\n               information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior organizational\n               official is designated by the department/agency head as the responsible individual to\n               implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized\n               integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare\n               department/agency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct\n               host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned\n               classified computers, provide insider threat awareness training to employees, receive\n               access to information from all offices within the department/agency (e.g., human\n               resources, legal, physical security, personnel security, information technology,\n               information system security, and law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and\n               conduct self-assessments of department/agency insider threat posture.

These precursors can better inform\n               and guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts.
