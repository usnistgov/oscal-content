# OSCAL Examples

This directory contains numerous OSCAL examples in XML, JSON, and YAML formats.

Some examples are considered provisional "finished" versions of OSCAL catalogs and profiles; they are not authoritative but are intended as demonstrations of OSCAL. Other examples are works in progress. Each subdirectory within the examples directory clearly indicates the current status of its example files.

These files are maintained by a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process that automatically converts source content into the alternate formats found in the many subdirectories of this repository. As a result, these example files should not be modified. Instead, the source of the file should be edited in the [src](src) subdirectories.

The structure and contents of the examples directory are as follows:

 * [nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4](nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4): This directory contains OSCAL examples of the catalog, and low, moderate, and high baselines defined by NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4.
 * [nist.gov/SP800-53/rev5](nist.gov/SP800-53/rev5): This directory contains OSCAL examples of the catalog, and low, moderate, and high baselines defined by NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53B Revision 5 and SP 800-53B Revision 5 respectively.
 * [fedramp.gov](fedramp.gov): This directory contains OSCAL examples of the low, moderate, and high baselines defined by FedRAMP (the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program).
 * [components](components): This directory contains sample OSCAL component files.
 * [mini-testing](mini-testing): This directory contains sample files that can be used for unit testing in support of regressions of OSCAL.
