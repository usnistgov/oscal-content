      In this example, the IaaS SSP specifies customer responsibilities for certain controls.


      The SaaS must address these for the control to be fully satisfied.


      The SaaS provider may either implement these directly, or pass the responsibility on to their customers. Both may be necessary.


      For any given control, the Leveraged IaaS SSP must describe:


      1. HOW the IaaS is directly satisfying the control

      1. WHAT responsibilities are left for the Leveraging SaaS (or their customers) to implement.



      For any given control, the Leveraging SaaS SSP must describe:


      1. WHAT is being inherited from the underlying IaaS

      1. HOW the SaaS is directly satisfying the control.

      1. WHAT responsibilities are left for the SaaS customers to implement. (The SaaS customers are Cust-A, B and C)
