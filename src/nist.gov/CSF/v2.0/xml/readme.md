# The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 Digitalized in OSCAL Formats

This subdirectory contains the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf) digitalized in OSCAL formats.

Data source here is published into the appropriate target directory, meaning that /src/nist.gov/CSF/v2.0/xml/ file is used to generate and publish information into the /nist.gov/CSF/v2.0 directory, *in all supported formats* (XML, JSON, YAML).

OSCAL artifacts in the /nist.gov/CSF/v2.0 directory are the preferred digital reference versions of the NIST CSF v2.0.
