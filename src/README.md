# OSCAL Examples

This directory contains numerous OSCAL examples in both XML and JSON formats. Some examples are considered provisional "finished" versions of OSCAL catalogs and profiles; they are not authoritative but are intended as demonstrations of OSCAL. Other examples are works in progress. Each subdirectory within the examples directory clearly indicates the current status of its example files.

The structure and contents of the examples directory are as follows:

 * [fedramp.gov](fedramp.gov): This directory contains examples in XML and JSON formats of the low, moderate, and high baselines defined by FedRAMP (the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program).
 * [nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4](nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4): This directory contains examples in XML and JSON formats of the low, moderate, and high baselines defined by NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4.
 * [mini-testing](mini-testing): This directory contains sample files that can be used for unit testing in support of regressions of OSCAL.
