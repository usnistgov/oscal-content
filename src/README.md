# OSCAL Examples Source

This directory contains the source files for all the OSCAL examples located in this repository.

**Automated:** The source for a given file is in one of the supported XML, JSON, or YAML formats. The Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) scripting automatically converts these content sources into the alternate formats. As a result, the example files, who's directories are located in the root directory of this repository, should not be modified. Instead, the source of the file should be edited here.

The structure and contents of the examples directory are as follows:

 * [nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4](nist.gov/SP800-53/rev4): This directory contains OSCAL examples of the catalog, and low, moderate, and high baselines defined by NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53 Revision 4.
