                <description>
                    <p>Once authenticated and authorized with a cross-account session, the security automation pipeline will execute scripts developed and maintained by the assessor's engineering support staff. It will analyze the permitted actions for the developer and system engineer roles in the GoodRead Product Team's AwesomeCloud account to confirm they are designed and implement to facilitate only least privilege operation. Examples are included below.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For the GoodRead developer role in their AwesomeCloud account, the developer role may only permit the user with this role to check the IP addresses and status of the Awesome Compute Service server instances. This role will not permit the user to create, change, or delete the instances. Similarly, the developer will permit a user to perform actions to see IP addresses of an Awesome Load Balancer instance, but not add, change, or delete the instances.</li>
                        <li>For the GoodRead system engineer role in their AwesomeCloud account, the system engineer role may only permit actions where the user can add, change, or delete instances for approved services (i.e. Awesome Compute Service, Awesome Load Balancer, et cetera). The role may not permit actions by the user for any other service.</li>

The <code>IFA-GoodRead-SystemEnginer</code> role in their respective AwesomeCloud account permitted use of the following high-risk actions.</p>

                <p>An account without proper least privilege design and implementation can be used to surreptitiously add, change, or delete cloud infrastructure to the too managing all links to IFA's communication to public citizens, potentially causing significant harm with no forensic evidence to recover the system.
