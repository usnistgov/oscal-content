            <p>The assessor's security automation platform analyzed all roles specific to the GoodRead Product Team, not those managed by the Office of Information Technology. The <code>IFA-GoodRead-SystemEnginer</code> role in their respective AwesomeCloud account permitted use of the following high-risk actions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>awesomecloud:auditlog:DeleteAccountAuditLog</li>
                <li>awesomecloud:secmon:AdministerConfigurations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both of these actions are overly permissive and not appropriate for the business function of the staff member assigned this role.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A user in the GoodRead cloud environment with the privileges of a system engineer can exceed the intended privileges for their related business function. They can delete all historical audit records and remove important security monitoring functions for the IFA Security Operations Center staff.</p>
        </description>
        <statement>
            <p>An account without proper least privilege design and implementation can be used to surreptitiously add, change, or delete cloud infrastructure to the too managing all links to IFA's communication to public citizens, potentially causing significant harm with no forensic evidence to recover the system. Regardless of the extent and duration of a potential incident, such a configuration greatly increases the risk of an insider threat if there were likely to a potential insider threat in the GoodRead Product Team.</p>
            <p>If such an insider threat existed and acted with this misconfigruatio, the resulting event could cause significant financial and reputational risk to IFA's Administrator, executive staff, and the agency overall.</p>

                <p>The GoodRead Product Team does not have siginficant mitigations or compensating controls to counter this risk, even if likelihood is low. The IFA CISO has cited ongoing guidance that potential insider threat risks be prioritized above alternative categories of risk for this quarter. Additionally, there is sufficient budget and unallocated time for the GoodRead and Office of Information Technology system engineers to modify AwesomeCloud IAM roles on or before the next continuous monitoring cycle beginning in July 2023. The planned completion data is June 23, 2023.</p>
